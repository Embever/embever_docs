# GNSS Simple

| Application name : `gnss_simple`

## Overview

The GNSS Simple sample application is a simple application which is
querying GNSS data. This example does not require any additional
hardware, just an Arduino compatible board and a compatible Embever CaaM
device supported by the Embever IoT library. To wire up the hardware
devices, follow the instruction in the [Wiring Diagram with no Additional Component](wiring_simple.md) topic.

The working principle of this application is to query and show a
different kind of GNSS data.

## Flashing

To upload this application to an Arduino compatible board navigate to
the examples and select the `gnss_simple` from the Embever IoT library
in Arduino IDE. Upload the sketch to the board and see the result in the
serial terminal.

## Testing the Application

To test the application, the necessary hardware connections should be
set up (as mentioned before). After powering up the device, it starts
querying GNSS data. To receive a valid position and other data, a
suitable GPS signal quality must be present.
