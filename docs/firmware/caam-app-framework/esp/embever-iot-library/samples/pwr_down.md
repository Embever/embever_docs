# Power Down Mode

Application name : `ebv_pwr_down`

## Overview

This sample application is using the power down mode feature of the {{CaaM}}
board. This example requires additional hardware setup to work properly:
a push button and an LED need to be connected to the arduino board. To
wire up the hardware devices, follow the instruction in the
[Wiring Diagram with no Additional Component](wiring_led_btn.md) topic.

The working principle of this application is to illustrate the {{CaaM}} board
power down mode. This is especially useful for battery powered
applications.

## Flashing

To upload this application to an Arduino compatible board navigate to
the examples and select the `ebv_pwr_down` from the Embever IoT library
in Arduino IDE. Upload the sketch to the board and see the result in the
serial terminal.

## Testing the Application

To test the application, the necessary hardware connections should be
done (as mentioned before). After powering up the device, the following
information should appear in the serial terminal:

``` none
Power down mode test sample
```

To start the demo press the external button. The following message will
appear in the serial terminal:

``` none
Sending sample event
Event sent
Put CaaM board to power down mode and wait 1 minute...
Sleep mode activated
```

After a sample event is sent to the cloud, the power down mode is
activated. About 1 minute later the sample application going to wake up
the {{CaaM}} board to send the sample event again.
