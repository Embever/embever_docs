# GNSS Report

Application name : `gnss_report`

## Overview

The GNSS Report sample application is using the location report feature
of the {{CaaM}} board. This example requires additional hardware setup to work
properly: a push button and an LED need to be connected to the arduino
board. To wire up the hardware devices, follow the instruction in the
[Wiring Diagram with no Additional Component](wiring_led_btn.md) topic.

The working principle of this application is to instruct the {{CaaM}} board to
send location data to the cloud. This is especially useful when the
application mcu has limited resources because it does not need to handle
all the gnss data and build the cloud message. The type of the location
event and the content of this event is preset, the application mcu can
not change it.

## Flashing

To upload this application to an Arduino compatible board navigate to
the examples and select the `gnss_report` from the Embever IoT library
in Arduino IDE. Upload the sketch to the board and see the result in the
serial terminal.

## Testing the Application

To test the application, the necessary hardware connections should be
done (as mentioned before). After powering up the device, the following
information should appear in the serial terminal:

``` none
GNSS Report sample starting
```

To issue the location report command press the external button. The
following message will appear in the serial terminal:

``` none
Report request submitted
```

After some time (at maximum 5 minute), based on the result of the
location report command the following message will be sent to the serial
terminal:

``` none
Location data sent to the cloud
```

In case of unsuccessful location report:

``` none
GPS fix timeout, location data not sent
```

To receive a valid position and other data, a suitable GPS signal
quality must be present.
