# The Integration Layer

The {{INT_LAYER}} aims to connect the {{EIOT}} with an external set of functions or with a
library which can provide the necessary functions to drive the {{I2C}} bus and
handle the GPIO interface. In this way, the {{EIOT}} is capable of use any
underlying implementation to issue commands on the {{I2C}} bus and read digital
states of a GPIO pin.

To achieve this functionality, the designed functions shall be provided
to the trough an internal type. This methodology is widely used to set
up interfaces in C language. There are already supported platforms in
the {{INT_LAYER}} , which can be used off-the-shelf.

The supported frameworks are:

-   Arduino

Using the supported platforms is straightforward. There are macro
definitions for setting up the necessary functions and passing them to
the {{INT_LAYER}} .

The example below shows how to set it up for the Arduino Wire Library.

``` c
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include "ebv_iot.h"

// Define interface functions
EBV_SETUP_ARDUINO_CB;

void setup() {
    // Passing the interface to the Integration layer
    EBV_REGISTER_ARDUINO_CB;
}

void loop(){

}
```

To get more information about how to set up and use the {{INT_LAYER}} please refer the
[Integration Guide-guide](../integration_guide.md) topic.
