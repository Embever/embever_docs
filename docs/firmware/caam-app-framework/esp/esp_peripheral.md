# Embever Serial Protocol Peripheral Application

The Embever Serial Protocol Peripheral (ESPP) application is implementing the peripheral role of the Embever Serial Protocol. It is designed for IoT enabled applications with simplicity in mind. It provides an interface to communicate with the embedded IoT core of the CaaM OS. With that, any external device communicating via the Embever Serial Protocol can connect and communicate with the Embever Cloud. For extended functionalities, the ESP also implement so called local control commands which are meant to control the device behaviors which is running the peripheral role of the ESP.

## Implementations of the ESPP application

The Embever Serial Protocol Peripheral application is using the CaaM Application Framework to integrate with the CaaM OS. It is using the same environment and APIs as any other custom application can access when using the CaaM Application Framework. Compiling the CaaM OS with the ESPP application is possible by anyone, however Embever distribute and maintains firmware images for the ESPP application.
