However, they cannot be sent to sleeping devices. Therefore, Embever IoT Core keeps a set of Action objects in a buffer. Actions in the Buffer will be sent to the device upon its next wakeup. All of this magic happens automatically. You don't have to do anything special here. However, it is important to note, that at maximum one Action of a particular type is kept in the buffer.\n\n::: note\nIf you create an Action with a type that already exist in the buffer, that existing Action instance will be overridden. That is, the previously buffered Action will be replaced by the new Action. The `result` attribute of the replaced Action will be set to `{\"overridden_by\" : <action_id>}` and the `finished` attribute will be set to `true`.\n:::\n\n### Action types\n\nThe type attribute of an Action can principally be choosen by the user. It is the responsibility of the developer to implement the corresponding action handlers in the device's firmware. The value of the `type` attribute must not start with `\"_\"`, since these action types are private (can only be set by Embever IoT Core).\n\n:::note\nThe value of the type attribute must not begin with `_`, e.g. `\"type\":\"_fota\"`\n:::\n\nEmbever IoT Core has some predefined action types, of which some some are private, i.e. can not be created by the user.\n\n#### Public occupied types\n\n`type` | Description\n---|---\n`\"getFile\"` | Used to send a file to the device. Must contain a `\"file\"` attribute. The value of the file attribute must be a bas64 encoded file. Optionally a `\"kwargs\"` object can be sepcified that is sent to the device.\n\n:::warning\nThis list might not be complete yet. Additional types might be occupied by Embever IoT Core in the future.\n:::\nExample getFile Action request object:\n\n```\n{\n    \"device\": {\n      \"id\": \"SB8rywL\"\n    },\n    \"type\": \"getFile\",\n    \"payload\": {\n      \"file\": \"data:image/epd;base64,aGVsbG93b3JsZA==\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExample corresponding getFile Action response object:\n\n```\n{\n    \"url\": \"https://api.embever.com/v2/actions/28/\",\n    \"id\": 28,\n    \"device\": {\n        \"id\": \"SB8rywL\",\n        \"name\": \"dev_emb\"\n    },\n    \"type\": \"getFile\",\n    \"payload\": {\n        \"file\": \"rULZsHiM\"\n    },\n    \"webhooks\": null,\n    \"status\": null,\n    \"service_level\": 0,\n    \"cancelled\": false,\n    \"finished\": false,\n    \"result\": null,\n    \"created_at\": \"2020-01-15T12:38:39.277934Z\",\n    \"result_code\": null,\n    \"expiry_date\": null,\n    \"expired\": false\n}\n```\n\n:::note\nThe value of `\"file\"` attribute on getFile Action request should be a string and follow the format `\"data:<filetype>/<format>;base64,<base64encoded_string>\"`. In the reposnse object the `\"file\"` attribute contains the saved file's id.\n:::\n\n#### Private types\n\n`type` | Description\n--- | ---\n`\"_fota\"` | Used for firmware updates over the air. Is automatically created when the user creates a deployment Object\n\n### Action status\n\nThe status of an Action changes over its lifecycle. The status attribute of an Action is an object that can contain the following attributes\n\nStatus | Description\n---|---\n`action_overridden` | Time at which the Action was overriden by a new Action.\n`action_sent` | Time at which the Action was sent to the device.\n`action_delivered` | Time at which the Action was delivered to the device.\n`response_received` | Time at which a response was received.\n\nActions of `type:getFile` and `type:_fota` can have additional statuses\n\nStatus | Description\n---|---\n`file_transfer_started` | Time at which a file transfer started\n`file_transfer_complete` | Time at which a file transfer completed\n`file_transfer_failed` | Time at which the file transfer was terminated unsuccessfully\n\nThe value of each attribute of a status object is a string indicating the time that status was reached. Example\n\n```\n{\n  \"action_sent\": \"2018-02-26T18:02:03.978399Z\",\n  \"action_delivered\": \"2018-02-26T18:05:03.978399Z\",\n  \"response_received\": \"2018-02-26T18:07:03.128399Z\",\n}\n```\n\n### Responses\n\nIf a response message is received from the device, its corresponding action will be updated. That is, a\n1. Its attribute `finished` will be set to `true`\n2. The payload of the response message will be added to the result attribute of the Action\n3. The corresponding `response_received` webhook will be executed\n\n### The finished attribute\n\nWhether an Action instance is considered finished depends on status of the delivery of the action. If the achieved service level is equal to or higher than the service level indicated in `service_level` attribute, the action is considered to be finished. Service Level 0 is the lowest and Service Level 2 is the highest. For example, if the action with `service_level=0` reaches the service level 0 or 1 or 2, the action is considered to be finished.\n1. If the action is `overridden`\n\nThe `finished` attribute is set to `true` as soon as the action status `action_overridden` is reached.\n\n2. If `cancelled=true`\n\n    The `finished` attribute is set to `true` as soon as the  `cancelled` attribute is set to `true`.\n\n3. If the achieved `service_level` is equal to or higher than the action's `service_level` attribute.\n\n    For `service_level=0`, `finished` attribute is set to `true` as soon as the action status `action_sent` or `action_delivered` or `response_received`  is reached.\n\n    For `service_level=1`,  `finished` attribute is set to `true` as soon as the action status `action_delivered` or `response_received`  is reached.\n\n    For `service_level=2`,  `finished` attribute is set to `true` as soon as the action status `response_received`  is reached.\n\n### Webhooks\n\nThe webhooks that are attached to an action are triggered when the status of an Action is updated. The status attribute of the webhook specifies which statuses trigger the webhook. You can determine multiple hooks for the same status of the action. After a webhook gets triggered, the created updated status object is send to the specified url using a POST request.\n\n:::warning\nWebhooks for all the action status are not implemented yet. Please refer to [Action Webhooks](#action-webhooks) for more info.\n:::\n\n### The cancelled Attribute\n\nThis field is primarily used to stop the action from sending to the device. Infact, this is the only field you can update in an Action. Suppose you create an Action (with id 001)of type \"getTemp\" with service level 2. The action is sent but the response is not received.  For some reasons, if the action is not finished (response is not received) then it is sent again and again until the response is received. This action (with id 001) is a blocking action. No action of same type \"getTemp\" can be sent unless this action is finished. So if you want to send a new action (id 002) of the same type \"getTemp\", you won't be able to send it. To avoid this problem, one can update the `\"cancelled\"` attribute of Action (001) to `true`. This will allow the next action (002) to be sent to the device.\n\n### Expiry of Actions\n\nAn action can be set to expire by setting the `\"expiry_date\"` attribute. After the set timestamp is reached, the action cannot be send to the device and the `\"expired\"` attribute is set to `true`. If the action is sent before the `\"expiry_date\"` the `\"expired\"` attribute is set to `false`.\n\n### Result Code of Actions\n\n:::note\nApplies to devices using Embever IoT Protocol version 2.1 or higher.\n:::\nWhen a response message is received from the device, the result code of the corresponding action is set to either `Success` or `Failure`, indicating whether the Action could be executed without errors in the IoT device."

To initialize a firmware update you need to create a Deployment instance, referencing:\n1. the Firmware instance that should be deployed (refer to the [Firmware section](#firmware))\n2. the devices which should update to the new firmware.\n\nThis way, You can initialize firmware updates for several devices at once. We highly recommend to start with a test Deployment. That is, referencing some devices that you have physical control of to check whether the new firmware does work properly.\n\n::: note\nTest your firmware update by creating a deplyoment for a set of test devices!\n:::\n\nAfter you created the deployment, Embever IoT Core will automatically generate an `_fota`-type Action instance for each of your devices (please refer to the [Actions section](#actions) for more info about Actions). This Action will then be scheduled for delivery. Upon the device's next wakeup it will receive this Action and proceed to download the correct firmware binary using our [File Transfer Service](#file-transfer). After the Update is complete, the device will send a response message and the corresponding Action, Update andDeployment instances will be updated accordingly.\n\n::: note\nWhen creating a new Deployment, Embever IoT Core checks whether unfinished Updates exist for referenced Devices. If this is the case, the creation of the Deployment instance will fail.\n:::\n\n### Description of Deployments\n\nA Deployment is an aggregation of firmware update operations.\n\nAttribute | Type | Description | Example\n---|---|---|---\nurl| String | URI of the ressource.|\nid | Integer |The unique identifier of the object. | `15`\ndevices | Array (Device IDs)  | Array of device IDs, referencing devices that shall perform the update.
