# Embever IoT Messaging

The Embever IoT Messaging layer is the top layer of the and is the only
one that the user application shall interact with. The Embever IoT
Messaging layer contains all the necessary functions which can be
required during transferring data between the cloud and devices. The
high level functions are designed to be easy to understand and simple to
use.

## Data exchange with the Embever Cloud system

To be able to use the Embever IoT solutions successfully, a few working
principles need to be clarified. Exchanging data with the Embever Cloud
System is done in 3 major forms:

-   Events
-   Actions
-   Responses

### The Embever Cloud Event

An event is the way to send data from the device to the cloud and has
two fiels:

-   **type** *(string)*: event kind
-   **payload** *(key-pair string)*: event content

This fields can be used freely during designing an application. The
**payload** is organized by key-value pairs like the following:

``` JSON
{
    "key":"value",
    "led_state":"on"
}
```

### The Embever Cloud Action

An action is the way to send data from the cloud to the device and has
four fields:

-   **type** *(string)*: action kind
-   **id** *(integer)*: action unique identification
-   **payload** *(key-pair string)*: action content
-   **service_level** *(integer)*: sets the action lifetime and supports
    3 different service levels:
    -   **0**: The action lives in the cloud while it has been sent to
        the device
    -   **1**: The action lives in the cloud while a response is not
        submitted for it
    -   **2**: The action lives in the cloud while a successful response
        is not submitted to it

For example, an action with **service level 0** will be in the cloud
while it is not queried by the device. As soon as the device queries it,
it will be marked in the cloud and not be sent to the device anymore. On
the other hand, actions with **service level 1** or **2** will be send
all the time, when the device queries actions until a response is not
submitted for them. The difference between **service level 1** and
**service level 2** is manner of the response result. In case of
**service level 1** the action will be marked and not be sent to the
device again if it get any valid response, the result code in this
response can be indicate failure or success, the action will be marked
in both cases. In case of **service level 2** the action will be marked
only if the response contain a success result code.

The **id** is automatically assigned on the cloud side and can be
omitted, the other fields can be used freely during designing an
application. The **payload** is organized by key-value pairs.

### The Embever Cloud Response

A response is a way to set the result of an action. It is a special type
of event, where the corresponding action identifier should be carried by
the device and sent to the cloud. It has tree fields:

-   **id** *(integer)*: should match the corresponding action
-   **result_code** *(integer)*: should be **0** for success and **1**
    for failure (as default on unix systems)
-   **payload** *(key-pair string)*: response *optional* content

As seen, the organization of the user payload is made by key-value pairs
just like a JSON object. This form makes possible to easily separate and
identify each value during their transfer to the cloud.

### Message type rules

The `type` field of an Embever IoT message is used to identify the
corresponding message. There are some rules in this naming schema which
need to be fulfil. The rules are the followings:

-   Can not start with `_` (e.g. `_sensor1` is invalid)
-   Can not be one of the following, this are reserved for the Embever
    Cloud System
    -   `getFile`

## Sending data to the cloud with the

``` c
ebv_iot_initGenericEvent("event_type_1");
ebv_iot_addGenericPayload("key1", "value1");
ebv_iot_addGenericPayload("key2", "value2");
ebv_iot_submitGenericEvent();
```

Sending data to the cloud is as simple as the above lines of code. First
create an event and set its type. The type can be any string which
fullfils the mentioned rules.

Next, specify a 2 key-value pair as part of the payload. Call this
function several times if you want to add more fields to the payload.
Finally, call the last function to submit the event to the cloud.

Let\'s see a practical example: sending temperature data of an apartment
to the cloud. A possible implementation would be the following:

``` c
ebv_iot_initGenericEvent("Temperature");
ebv_iot_addGenericPayload("living_room", 24.7);
ebv_iot_addGenericPayload("bath_room", 28.2);
ebv_iot_addGenericPayload("kitchen", 26.1);
ebv_iot_addGenericPayload("bed_room", 23);
ebv_iot_addGenericPayload("is_alarm_triggered", false);
ebv_iot_submitGenericEvent();
```

The sample above covers temperature data from 4 different places around
the apartment and indicating an alarm state too. The equivalent data in
JSON is the following:

``` json
[
    "Temperature",
    {
        "living_room" : 24.7,
        "bath_room" : 28.2,
        "kitchen" : 26.1,
        "bed_room" : 23,
        "is_alarm_triggered" : false
    }
]
```
