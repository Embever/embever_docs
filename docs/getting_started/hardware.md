# Hardware
Meet the [CaaM Mini](../hardware/dev-board/index.md), an easy-to-use evaluation board running the Caam OS on an nRF9160 SoC from Nordic Semiconductor. It allows to use LTE networks like LTE Cat-NB1, LTE Cat-M1 and it is equipped with an integrated GNSS receiver. The CaaM Mini minimalistic design makes it perfect for prototyping and evaluating IoT applications. Due to its small form factor, the CaaM Mini is ideal to integrate with any kind of hardware.

## Prototyping
One of the main goals of the CaaM board family is to make the prototyping and evaluation phase as smooth as possible. The CaaM Mini is designed to be used in the prototyping phase. It allows to set up a hardware prototype with any kind of hardware event without an external micro controller unit. Thanks to the wide range of operating voltage and low current consumption capabilities, the CaaM Mini can be used to evaluate battery powered applications as well. Moreover, using the [Embever Serial Protocol](../firmware/caam-app-framework/esp/esp-overview.md), a lightweight serial protocol based on I2C , takes only 4 data lines to set up an IoT enabled device.

## Production
To put the CaaM boards to the next level, it might be required to design a custom printed circuit board in order to make a perfect fit for the IoT enabled hardware device. For this purpose the hardware blueprints of the CaaM hardware is available to anyone, along with support and guidance from Embever.
Only 3 active components are required to fulfill the CaaM hardware design requirements, shrinking down the development time and being cost effective from the first design sketch to mass production.
