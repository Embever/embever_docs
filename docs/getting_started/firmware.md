# CaaM Application Framework
The CaaM OS allows to integrate custom application logic with the Embever IoT Core. This means, that no other programable unit is required to deploy an IoT enabled application. Using a rich set of APIs and standard embedded development tools, building IoT applications was never that easy. To get started, take a look at the [User Application Framework](../firmware/caam-app-framework/custom-app-framework/index.md) topic.

# Embever Serial Client Application
The [Embever Serial Protocol (ESP)](../firmware/caam-app-framework/esp/esp-overview.md) is a lightweight serial protocol designed for Internet of Things applications. The Embever Serial Client (ESC) application is an ESP command interpreter implementing the ESP client role. The ESC is designed to be easily integrated into any existing embedded environment, providing a simple API to communicate with the Embever Cloud. This setup allows easy integration of any CaaM board into an existing embedded system. To read more about the Embever Serial Client application, see the [Embever Serial Client](../firmware/caam-app-framework/esp/esp-overview.md) topic.
