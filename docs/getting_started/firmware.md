# CaaM Application Framework

The User Application Framework or UAF is a custom application framework in the Embever Connectivity Firmware. The goal of the UAF is to let the users build their own custom applications within the Embever Connectivity Firmware. This provides the possibility to combine the [Embever Connectivity Core](../firmware/index.md#caam-connectivity-core) with any custom application logic in a single application. To get started with the UAF, follow the [Getting Started with the Embever User Application Framework](../firmware/caam-app-framework/custom-app-framework/index.md) guide.

# Embever Serial Client Application

The [Embever Serial Protocol (ESP)](../firmware/caam-app-framework/esp/esp-overview.md) is a lightweight serial protocol designed for Internet of Things messaging. The Embever Serial Client (ESC) application is an ESP command interpreter implementing the ESP client role. The ESC is designed to be easily integrated into any existing IoT environment as well as into the Embever Connectivity Firmware UAF. Using the ESC user application allows to any embedded system or so called application microcontroller (APP MCU) to send commands to the Embever Connectivity Firmware via the Embever Serial Protocol. This setup allows easy integration of any CaaM hardware into an existing system. To read more about the Embever Serial Client user application, see the [Embever Serial Client](../firmware/caam-app-framework/esp/esp-overview.md) topic.
