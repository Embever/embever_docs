# What is Cloud-as-a-Module (CaaM)
Cloud as a Module is a connectivity service which transfers data cellularly from your device hardware to the Cloud and can forwards it to any ERP system or external systems.
It can be fully incorporated into any electronic devices and using the exposed API/libraries on the hardware side the device can send the data to the cloud. CaaM provices full connectivity as a service solution by simplifying MNO integration, energy efficienct transfer which leds to faster time to market for an IoT Product. Not only it is faster to develop IoT solutions with CaaM but it is also easier to maintain and reliable.
