# Choosing the right path
Cloud as a Module (CaaM) enables user to build reliable and secure IoT application with minimum effort and ease. For this CaaM comes with rich set of IoT features and secure connectivity out of box. Depending on your requirement you can follow different path to quickly build your IoT application with cloud connectivity.

### Exsiting Frimware
Do you already have an existing firmware for your IoT application and are looking for a communication device? Then, you can simply use I2C, SPI or UART to connect your existing embeded device to CaaM OS for connectivity to send and receive data from the cloud.
To get started follow [Embever Serial Protocol](../getting_started/esp.md).

### Planning on writing your application firmware
If you are planning to writing your own firmware for your IoT application. Then you can use the User Application Framework to write your application using the rich set of APIs that it offers for standard IoT features with secured connectivity out of box. To get started with developing with User Application Framework follow [User Application Framework](../getting_started/uaf.md).
