<!-- # Choosing the right path
Cloud as a Module (CaaM) enables user to build reliable and secure IoT application with minimum effort and ease. For this CaaM comes with rich set of IoT features and secure connectivity out of box. Depending on your requirement you can follow different path to quickly build your IoT application with cloud connectivity.

### Exsiting Frimware
Do you already have an existing firmware for your IoT application and are looking for a communication device? Then, you can simply use I2C, SPI or UART to connect your existing embeded device to CaaM OS for connectivity to send and receive data from the cloud.
To get started follow [Embever Serial Protocol](../getting_started/esp.md).

### Planning on writing your application firmware
If you are planning to writing your own firmware for your IoT application. Then you can use the User Application Framework to write your application using the rich set of APIs that it offers for standard IoT features with secured connectivity out of box. To get started with developing with User Application Framework follow [User Application Framework](../getting_started/uaf.md).

# Choosing the Right Integration Path

Cloud as a Module (CaaM) empowers users to create reliable and secure IoT applications with minimal effort.
CaaM offers a comprehensive set of IoT features and secure connectivity, right out of the box.
There are two primary integration options available with the CaaM solution:

### 1. Established Application Firmware

This integration is ideal for existing applications that require IoT capabilities.
The CaaM embedded solution provides a lightweight, easy-to-use, IoT-focused communication protocol that leverages common serial bus systems like I2C, SPI, or UART.
This option is the quickest way to unlock the advantages of IoT connectivity.  
To get started, please refer to the [Embever Serial Protocol Guide](../getting_started/esp.md).

### 2. New Product Development

This integration is best suited for developing new IoT products.
The CaaM Application Firmware allows you to run custom embedded firmware directly on the main control unit, offering seamless integration and maximizing the potential of the CaaM embedded operating system.  
To begin with the CaaM Application Framework, consult the [CaaM Application Framework Guide](../getting_started/uaf.md).
